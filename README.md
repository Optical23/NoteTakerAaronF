### Note Taker express.js app

## Description
This app is a note taking app using an express server to handle file handling, save and delete request.
This challenge was a test of abilities for using express.js routes using pre-written front end code. 

## Approach
My approach to this problem was to understand the request from the index.js file and what they needed in return. Then I made the routes inside the server.js file.
The routes I created was not a lot of code so I kept them in one file, instead of making a routes folder and dividing my routes into separate files.
